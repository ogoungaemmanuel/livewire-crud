## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **PHP 8.1+** with required extensions (mbstring, openssl, pdo, tokenizer, xml)
- **Composer 2.0+** for dependency management
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm** for frontend assets
- **Git** for version control
- A **Laravel 9+** application for testing

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/livewire-crud.git
   cd livewire-crud
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Git Hooks** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   composer run setup-hooks
   ```

## üõ† Development Environment

### Local Testing

To test your changes locally:

1. **Create a test Laravel project**

   ```bash
   composer create-project laravel/laravel test-app
   cd test-app
   ```

2. **Add your local package**

   ```json
   // composer.json
   "repositories": [
       {
           "type": "path",
           "url": "../livewire-crud"
       }
   ]
   ```

3. **Install the package**
   ```bash
   composer require "ogoungaemmanuel/livewire-crud:*"
   ```

### Code Quality Tools

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **StyleCI**: Automated code style fixing
- **PHPStan**: Static analysis (Level 8)
- **Pest**: Modern testing framework
- **Rector**: Automated refactoring
- **PHP CS Fixer**: Code style enforcement

Run all quality checks:

```bash
composer run quality
```

## üìù Coding Standards

We follow modern PHP and Laravel best practices:

### PHP Standards

- **PSR-12** coding standard (evolution of PSR-2)
- **PHPDoc** blocks for all public methods and properties
- **Type hints** for all parameters and return types
- **Strict types** declaration in all PHP files
- **Modern PHP features** (PHP 8.1+ syntax)

### Laravel Conventions

- **Eloquent models** with proper relationships and accessors
- **Service classes** for complex business logic
- **Form requests** for validation
- **Resources** for API transformations
- **Jobs** for background processing

### Frontend Standards

- **Bootstrap 5** for styling (no Tailwind)
- **Alpine.js** for JavaScript reactivity
- **ES6+** modern JavaScript syntax
- **Responsive design** principles
- **Accessibility** (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

### Code Organization

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Http\Livewire;

use Livewire\Component;
use Livewire\WithPagination;

/**
 * User management component with CRUD operations
 */
class UserComponent extends Component
{
    use WithPagination;

    public string $search = '';
    public bool $showModal = false;

    /**
     * Render the component view
     */
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.user-component', [
            'users' => $this->getUsers(),
        ]);
    }

    /**
     * Get filtered users with pagination
     */
    private function getUsers(): LengthAwarePaginator
    {
        return User::query()
            ->when($this->search, fn($q) => $q->where('name', 'like', "%{$this->search}%"))
            ->latest()
            ->paginate(10);
    }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

We use **Pest** for testing with comprehensive coverage requirements:

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual classes and methods
2. **Feature Tests** - Test complete workflows
3. **Browser Tests** - Test JavaScript interactions
4. **Integration Tests** - Test package installation

### Writing Tests

```php
<?php

use App\Models\User;

test('can create user through livewire component')
    ->expect(function () {
        $component = Livewire::test(UserComponent::class)
            ->set('name', 'John Doe')
            ->set('email', 'john@example.com')
            ->call('create');

        expect(User::where('email', 'john@example.com')->exists())->toBeTrue();
        expect($component->get('showModal'))->toBeFalse();
    });

test('validates required fields')
    ->expect(function () {
        Livewire::test(UserComponent::class)
            ->set('name', '')
            ->set('email', '')
            ->call('create')
            ->assertHasErrors(['name', 'email']);
    });
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run with coverage
composer test:coverage

# Run specific test suite
composer test:unit
composer test:feature

# Run tests in parallel
composer test:parallel
```

### Coverage Requirements
